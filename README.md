# EZB's Advent of Code 2022

This repo contains my implementations for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

Before running the code, make sure you have Node v16+ installed. Then, install the dependencies of the project by
running `yarn` or `npm i`.

Once you've done that, running each day - for example, day 1 - is as simple as `yarn run day1` or `npm run day1`.
